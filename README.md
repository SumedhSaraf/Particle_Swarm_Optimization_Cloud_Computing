# Particle_Swarm_Optimization_Cloud_Computing
### Problem Statement
Cloud computing mainly deals with offering Infrastructure as a service,Platforms as a service and Internet as a service inside
its own virtualized Infrastructure. Allocation of resources to servers in a cloud environment across different data centres which
gives a optimized solution by increasing the company profits and decreasing the bandwidth consumption is difficult. This project 
aims at finding a optimized solution to select data centers of a company/firm in the most efficient way
